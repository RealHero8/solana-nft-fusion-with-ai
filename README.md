## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Rust and Cargo
- Solana CLI tools
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cashblaze129/solana-nft-fusion-with-ai.git
   cd solana-nft-fusion-with-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install Rust dependencies
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment
- Deploy our custom Solana smart contract for NFT fusion
- Backend automatically creates and manages NFT collections
- Contract handles token payments and NFT transfers

### 2. NFT Purchase & Collection
- Users browse available NFT collections created by our backend
- Click "Buy" button to purchase NFTs using tokens
- Smart contract processes the transaction and transfers NFT ownership
- Users can view their purchased NFTs in their wallet

### 3. NFT Selection for Fusion
- Users select multiple purchased NFTs from their collection
- Interface displays selected NFTs with their attributes
- System validates NFT ownership and compatibility

### 4. AI-Powered Fusion Generation
- AI analyzes selected NFT images and extracts visual attributes
- Advanced algorithms enhance and combine the selected images
- Generate new fusion image based on parent NFT characteristics
- Apply style transfer and quality enhancement

### 5. New NFT Minting
- Mint the newly generated fusion image as a new NFT
- Store metadata on decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave)
- Maintain provenance links to parent NFTs
- Update user's collection with the new fusion NFT

### 6. User Experience Flow
- Intuitive web interface for NFT browsing and selection
- Real-time preview of fusion results
- One-click buying and minting process
- Seamless wallet integration

## 🎨 AI Models

Our system utilizes state-of-the-art AI models for image generation:

- **Stable Diffusion**: For high-quality image generation
- **StyleGAN**: For attribute-based image synthesis
- **Custom Fusion Models**: For combining multiple NFT attributes
- **Quality Enhancement**: Post-processing for optimal results
